# HW1

## How to do the homework?

You have accepted the invitation to the assignment, and now you have to copy the files so that you can start your work. This instruction assumes that you are using the command line git. In case you want to use GitHub Desktop, see the document "Homework How To" in Class Notebook of MS Teams. 

In command window, 

1. First go to your class folder, say `/MAE6292`. If you wish to use Google Colab, the class folder should be under your Google Drive. If you plan to use Jupyter Notebook, it can be anywhere in your drive.

2. Execute 

   ``git clone https://github.com/GW-MAE6292/hw1-tylee-fdcl.git ./hw1`` 

   This will copy the above files to your folder `/MAE6292/hw1'

3. Now, open `hw1.ipynb` using Google Colad or Juptyer Notebook and complete the work.

4. Once your work is done, there will be two new files, 'prob1.png' and `prob2.png`. You have to package these files in git, before submitting it.

   ``git add prob1.png prob2.png``

   ``git commit -a -m "done~"``

5. Now, you are ready to submit your work by

   ``git push``

   You may have to enter your GitHub id and password, if this is the first time pusing something to github.

6. Finally, come back to this page, to make it sure that all of your files are posted properly.
